    <h1>Welcome to A Rainbow Abacus</h1>
    <h2>Introductions</h2>

         <p>I'm Jess; by way of introduction here are a few words about me:</p>

         <p>Happiest with a cup of tea after a long walk somewhere green.
            Typically I'm even happier if it's been rainy and blustery or 
            I have managed to get my feet muddy. 

            In the recent past I've been a student of Literature and Philosophy. 
            I like to ask lots of questions, knowing that most will lack the clear, 
            simple answers we all to often seek.
            
            At present I'm delving into the world of data. 
            I'm interested in the questions we can ask; the stories we can tell;
             and the positive change we can create.</p>

        <p>In general I hope to use this website to present my current adventures in to the world of Data!
            It won't all be numbers, graphs and statistics because I quite like words too.
        I am new to coding in general, so for the time being this website will remain very basic.</p>
